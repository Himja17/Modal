          Nineteenth-century British surgeon George Merryweather believed
          leeches could predict the weather. His "tempest prognosticator,"

          Walt Disney World is a surprisingly popular place for people to
          scatter their loved one's ashes. Disney, understandably, takes a

          remains onto the property will be kicked out.

          A solar eclipse helped end a six-year war in 585 BCE. When the sky
          suddenly darkened during a battle between the Lydians and the Medes in
          modern Turkey, soldiers took it as a sign to cease fighting.
